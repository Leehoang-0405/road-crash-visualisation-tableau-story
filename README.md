# road-crash-visualisation-tableau-story
A Tableau storytelling project exploring road crash and injury data in Victoria, using interactive dashboards and visual best practices to uncover insights and drive safety recommendations.

Project Overview

This project is a data storytelling and visualisation analysis based on crash and injury data from Victoria Police and hospital reports. Using Tableau’s Storyboard feature, I developed a dynamic, visual narrative to uncover critical insights into road safety issues across Victoria.

The objective was to communicate a compelling and evidence-based story that highlights key crash patterns and risk factors, while providing clear, actionable recommendations to the intended audience—such as government authorities, policymakers, or the public.
